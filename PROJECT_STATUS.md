### 📋 Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Add Home Assistant Input Entities (ESPHome side)
**Goal:** Subscribe to HA input entities and store values locally on ESP32

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add `homeassistant` text sensor for IAC (input_boolean.activar_calefaccion_pileta)
- [ ] Add `homeassistant` sensor for ITO (input_number.pileta_temp_objetivo)
- [ ] Add `homeassistant` sensor for IMX (input_number.pileta_temp_max_diff)
- [ ] Add `homeassistant` sensor for IMI (input_number.pileta_temp_min_diff)
- [ ] Configure sensors to update on HA state change
- [ ] Add globals to store last-known values for offline operation

**Expected outcome:** ESP32 can read and store HA configuration values

---

#### Phase 2: Implement Core Control Logic
**Goal:** Create interval component to evaluate heating conditions and control relays

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add `interval` component (check every 30 seconds)
- [ ] Implement turn-ON logic:
  - Check IAC is enabled (true)
  - Check SAG < (ITO - 0.5°C) — dead zone
  - Check SCL > (SAG + IMX) — heater sufficiently hot
  - If ALL true: turn on `pileta_calefaccion_completa`
- [ ] Implement turn-OFF logic:
  - Check SAG ≥ ITO — target reached
  - Check SCL ≤ (SAG + IMI) — heater too cold
  - Check IAC is disabled
  - If ANY true: turn off `pileta_calefaccion_completa`
- [ ] Add logging for decision points

**Expected outcome:** Basic heating control works based on temperature and configuration

---

#### Phase 3: Add Time-Based Control (Optional)
**Goal:** Implement 18:00 cutoff if ESP32 has reliable time

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add ESPHome `time` platform (SNTP)
- [ ] Configure time zone (America/Argentina/Buenos_Aires)
- [ ] Add time check in turn-OFF logic (if hour >= 18)
- [ ] Add flag to prevent new heating cycles after 17:45
- [ ] Test time synchronization reliability

**Expected outcome:** System stops heating at 18:00 automatically

**Note:** May skip if WiFi instability makes time sync unreliable

---

#### Phase 4: Add Disconnection Handling
**Goal:** Ensure safe operation when WiFi/HA connection lost

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add `on_connect` automation to retrieve current HA values
- [ ] Add `on_disconnect` automation to log event
- [ ] Verify globals retain values during disconnection
- [ ] Test behavior: ESP32 continues with last-known values when offline
- [ ] Add `on_shutdown` automation to turn off both pumps

**Expected outcome:** ESP32 operates autonomously during disconnections, safe shutdown

---

#### Phase 5: Testing & Validation
**Goal:** Verify correct behavior in all scenarios

**Test Cases:**
- [ ] **Normal operation:** Heating turns on when conditions met
- [ ] **Dead zone:** No rapid cycling when temperature near target
- [ ] **Safety timers:** Pumps shut off after timeout (1h pump, 8h heater)
- [ ] **Parameter changes:** ESP32 responds to HA input changes
- [ ] **WiFi loss:** Continues with last values, reconnects properly
- [ ] **Manual override:** Can turn off heating manually via HA
- [ ] **IAC disable:** Heating stops immediately when IAC disabled
- [ ] **Temperature reached:** Heating stops when SAG ≥ ITO
- [ ] **Heater too cold:** Heating stops when SCL ≤ (SAG + IMI)
- [ ] **18:00 cutoff:** (if implemented) No new cycles after 18:00

**Deployment:**
- [ ] Copy updated YAML to Home Assistant
- [ ] Validate YAML syntax in ESPHome Dashboard
- [ ] Compile firmware via ESPHome Dashboard
- [ ] Flash to ESP32 (USB or OTA)
- [ ] Monitor logs for 24-48 hours
- [ ] Document any issues or unexpected behavior

---

#### Future Enhancements (After Successful Testing)
- [ ] Implement runtime tracking (daily heating hours)
- [ ] Add parameter validation alert (IMX ≥ IMI + 1°C)
- [ ] Create HA dashboard for monitoring and visualization
- [ ] Add historical logging to track efficiency
- [ ] Optimize heating schedule based on solar patterns
- [ ] Add weather forecast integration
- [ ] Implement predictive heating start time

### 🔧 Technical Implementation Notes

**ESPHome Components to Use:**
- `homeassistant.text_sensor` - For boolean inputs from HA
- `homeassistant.sensor` - For numeric inputs from HA
- `globals` - Store values persistently during disconnection
- `interval` - Periodic evaluation of control logic
- `time.sntp` - Time synchronization (optional)
- `on_connect`/`on_disconnect` - Handle WiFi events
- `on_shutdown` - Safe shutdown procedure
- `script` - Reusable logic blocks

**Key Variables:**
- IAC: Master enable (boolean from HA)
- ITO: Target temperature (float from HA)
- IMX: Max temp difference for turn-ON (float from HA)
- IMI: Min temp difference for turn-OFF (float from HA)
- SAG: Current water temp (float from sensor)
- SCL: Current heater temp (float from sensor)

**Safety Considerations:**
- Existing timers already implemented (1h pump, 8h heater)
- Must respect these timeouts in control logic
- Turn off pumps on ESP32 shutdown
- Continue operation with last-known values if HA unavailable

## Development History

### Session 2025-11-02: Documentation Cleanup
**Accomplished:**
- Analyzed all project files for inconsistencies
- Created CLAUDE.md with comprehensive guidance
- Renamed configuration file to correct name
- Removed redundant and outdated files
- Reorganized README and PROJECT_STATUS to eliminate overlap
- Committed changes to GitHub

**Key Decisions:**
- Secrets managed in ESPHome Dashboard (not in repo)
- README = project description, PROJECT_STATUS = session memory
- WARP_HA_DEBUG kept as separate HA debugging reference

### Session 2025-11-01: Project Recovery
**Accomplished:**
- Recovered project after files deleted from HA
- Restored esp32-pileta.yaml from backup
- Documented hardware configuration
- Created comprehensive documentation

**Context:**
- All configuration files were deleted from Home Assistant
- Project reconstructed on local Windows machine
- Hardware documented: 3x temp sensors, light sensor, 2x relays
- MQTT broker integration (192.168.1.8)
- Ready for deployment

### Original Setup 2025-10-24
**Accomplished:**
- Initial configuration created
- Validated on Home Assistant
- Identified memory constraints on HA host
- Documented alternative compilation methods

---

## Known Issues & Constraints

### 1. Memory Limitation on HA Host
- **Issue:** Direct compilation fails with memory errors
- **Workaround:** Use ESPHome Dashboard exclusively
- **Status:** Documented, workaround established

### 2. GPIO2 Strapping Pin
- **Issue:** GPIO2 may affect boot sequence
- **Status:** Documented, needs monitoring after flash
- **Mitigation:** Can reassign to different GPIO if needed

### 3. Unstable WiFi Connection
- **Context:** Design constraint, not a bug
- **Solution:** Hybrid architecture with ESP32 autonomy
- **Status:** Addressed in architecture design
